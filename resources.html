                <h3>What is Type 3c and why is it different?</h3>
                <p>Type 3c (pancreatogenic) diabetes occurs when the pancreas is damaged by surgery, pancreatitis, or cystic fibrosis. Unlike T1 or T2, it often involves a total lack of both insulin and digestive enzymes, requiring a unique approach to management.</p>

                <p>After a year of "heavy lifting" and manual data extraction, I realized that existing apps ignored the complex relationship between enzyme therapy, protein absorption, and glucose stability. GlycoTrace was born from that frustration.</p>

            <h2>What is Type 3c Diabetes?</h2>
            <p>Type 3c diabetes, also known as pancreatogenic diabetes, is often misdiagnosed as Type 2. However, its origin is physical damage to the pancreas. This means the body isn't just "resistant" to insulin; it has lost the complex machinery that produces it, alongside the glucagon and digestive enzymes needed for stability.</p>
            <p>For a lifter or athlete, this creates a "Double Jeopardy" scenario. You need the enzymes to absorb the protein for muscle growth, but those same enzymes change how quickly carbohydrates hit your system. GlycoTrace is the first app to put enzyme tracking at the center of the timeline.</p>

            <h2>The Founder's Story: From Data to Recovery</h2>
            <p>In 2024, my life changed with a diagnosis that required total pancreatic surgery. As a software engineer and a weightlifter, I did what I knew best: I started collecting data. I found that I was jumping between four different apps just to see the "Why" behind a 3 AM hypoglycemic event or a post-workout spike.</p>
            <p>I built GlycoTrace to bridge the gap. I wanted a tool that understood that a spike during a heavy squat set isn't a failure—it's a biological response. By centralizing Libre data, enzyme logs, and exercise, we can finally see the full picture.</p>

            <h2>Managing Heavy Lifting & Blood Sugar</h2>
            <p>When you lift heavy, your body enters a "fight or flight" mode. This triggers the liver to dump glucose into the bloodstream to fuel your muscles. For those with Type 3c, this spike can be sharp and intimidating. The key is understanding <strong>Glucoflow AI</strong>'s distinction between "dietary fuel" and "stress fuel."</p>
            <p>By tracking your lifting sets alongside your glucose trends, GlycoTrace helps you identify your specific "spike threshold," allowing you to stay in the zone without the fear of uncontrolled highs or the "post-gym crash."</p>
