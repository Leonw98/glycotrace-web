                    <h2>From Spreadsheets to Stability.</h2>
                    <p>I’m <strong>Leon Wilkinson</strong>. When I was diagnosed with Type 3c diabetes, my relationship with my body changed overnight. I wanted to stay active and feel healthy, but my blood sugar felt like a puzzle where half the pieces were missing.</p>
                    <p>I’ve learned a lot on this journey. I spent a year Intermittent Fasting with hardly any results, frustrated that the 'standard' advice wasn't working. I discovered the hard way that as a diabetic, things are different—I saw how eating high protein could unexpectedly spike my sugar, and how activity that should have dropped my levels sometimes did the opposite.</p>
                    <p>I realized that for us, <strong>glucose, insulin, and activity all need to be in perfect alignment</strong> to see progress. I built <strong>GlycoTrace</strong> to highlight those connections. It’s a companion that helps you find the "Why" behind the numbers, so you can spend less time guessing and more time living.</p>

GlycoTrace provides a tailored <strong>"Fat Burning Forecast"</strong> that adapts to your classification—whether you're Type 1, Type 3c, or Pre-Diabetic—accounting for active insulin windows and glucose stability.</p>

                    <h4>Why is Type 3c management different?</h4>
                    <p>Type 3c involves both insulin and glucagon deficiency, making stability much harder to predict. GlycoTrace highlights the subtle patterns other apps miss.</p>

                    <h4>How does it support Fasting?</h4>
                    <p>We use clinical markers to estimate when your body transitions between "Processing Fuel" and "Fat Burning," tailored specifically to your diabetes type.</p>
