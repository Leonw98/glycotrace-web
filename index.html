                    <h2>From the Gym to the Spreadsheet.</h2>
                    <p>I’m <strong>Leon Wilkinson</strong>. As a Type 3c diabetic, I spent a year pushing my body to its limits—literally. I was in the gym lifting heavy to lose fat and gain strength, but my Libre was telling a confusing story. I’d finish a set and see my blood sugar skyrocket.</p>
                    <p>I spent months pulling my gym logs into spreadsheets alongside my glucose data to figure out <strong>why</strong>. I built the first version of <strong>GlycoTrace</strong> to do that work for me. Now, through <strong>GlycoTrace Ltd</strong>, I’ve refined it into the tool I needed on Day 1—a companion that understands that a spike after a heavy session isn't the same as a spike after a pizza.</p>

While your sensor tells you what is happening right now, GlycoTrace looks back to tell you why. It’s a <strong>Hindsight Clarity</strong> tool designed to turn your data into a metabolic roadmap.</p>

                    <h4>Why is Type 3c management different?</h4>
                    <p>Type 3c involves both insulin and glucagon deficiency, making stability much harder. GlycoTrace highlights the subtle patterns other apps miss.</p>

                    <h4>Can I use this for weight loss?</h4>
