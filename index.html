                    <h2>Solving my own puzzle.</h2>
                    <p>I’m <strong>Leon Wilkinson</strong>. When I was diagnosed with Type 3c diabetes (and yes, I didn’t know it was a thing either), my relationship with my body changed overnight. I wanted to stay active, but my blood sugar felt like a puzzle where half the pieces were missing.</p>
                    <p>I’ve learned a lot on this journey. I spent a year Intermittent Fasting with hardly any results, frustrated that the 'standard' advice wasn't working. I discovered that as a diabetic, things are different—I saw how eating high protein could unexpectedly spike my sugar, and how activity that should have dropped my levels sometimes did the opposite.</p>
                    <p>I realized that for us, <strong>glucose, insulin, and activity all need to be in perfect alignment</strong> to see progress. I built this app to highlight those connections for myself, and it has been a game-changer. Now, I want to make it available for others facing the same mystery.</p>

                    <h4>Why is Type 3c management different?</h4>
                    <p>Type 3c involves both insulin and glucagon deficiency, making stability much harder to predict. GlycoTrace highlights the subtle patterns other apps miss.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>Are there differences for men and women?</h4>
                    <p>Yes. Women often experience significant fluctuations in insulin sensitivity during different phases of their hormonal cycle. We build this context into our analysis.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>Is my data private?</h4>
                    <p>Absolutely. GlycoTrace is a retrospective analysis tool. We sync your data securely to provide insights, but you remain the sole owner of your health journey.</p>
